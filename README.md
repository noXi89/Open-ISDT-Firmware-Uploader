# Open-ISDT-Firmware-Uploader (Windows)
This is the first step for an open source firmware for ISDT chargers. 

This downloader currently allows you to load every (encrypted) firmware to every ISDT charger. It's skipping the Hardwarecheck. E.g. you could flash the Q6 Pro firmware to the Q6 Lite charger.

**This will obviously brick your charger! DO AT YOUR OWN RISK**

**To prevent damage, no executable files shall be uploaded.**

You could also modify the firmware and flash your own versions with it.
